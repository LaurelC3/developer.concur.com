Connecting Virtuo for Business with Concur Expense means that every time you finish a rental that needs to be expensed, the rental information will automatically appear in your Concur Expense account with an attached e-receipt, enabling you to manage your expenses easily and efficiently.

Virtuo for Business is a platform through which employees can rent cleaned and sanitised cars through a human-less process, 24/7, from airports, train stations, and city centers. Virtuo for Business is here to ensure your safety and comfort when travelling as well as offering you lower prices.
