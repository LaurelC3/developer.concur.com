## Currency Admin Configuration

In order for users to submit expense reports based on uploaded exchange rates, the expense administrator may consider additional configurations.

As the administrator, navigate to the Currency Admin page:

**Administration** >> **Expense** >> **Expense Admin** >> **Currency Admin** >> **Settings**

* Ensure **Currently Loaded Exchange Rates** is checked to consume exchange rates.
* The Exchange Rate Source provides three options in which what rates are retrieved:
  * Search Local then External Sources: Custom rates are loaded first and, if not found, consume rates from an external source.
  * Use Local Exchange Rates Only: Custom rates only.
  * Use External Exchange Rates Only: Our default external exchange rate source is OANDA Live Exchange Rates.
* Exchange rate **Markup** (percentage): Increase all rates returned by an additional percentage.
* Allow **Inversion** of currency rate pairs: As currency rates are bidirectional, this allows retrieval of a rate in the opposite direction of an uploaded exchange rate, calculated as an inverse of the original rate.
